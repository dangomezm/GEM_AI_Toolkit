def get_road_orientation(location):
    """
    Determine the road orientation (azimuth) near a specified location using the Google Roads API.

    This function queries the Google Roads API to find the nearest road to the given geographic 
    location (latitude, longitude). If a snapped road point is found, it calculates the azimuth 
    (orientation) of the road segment relative to the specified location.

    Args:
        location (tuple): A tuple containing the latitude and longitude of the target location 
        (e.g., `(latitude, longitude)`).

    Returns:
        float: The road azimuth in degrees, or `None` if no road is found or an error occurs.

    Effects:
        - Sends a request to the Google Roads API to find the nearest road.
        - Prints messages to the console for debugging or error handling.

    Notes:
        - Requires a valid Google Roads API key (`api_key`) to make requests.
        - Uses a helper function `compute_azimuth` to calculate the azimuth between two points.
        - Handles API errors and missing road data gracefully.

    Compute the azimuth (bearing) between two geographic points.

    This function calculates the azimuth in degrees between two points on the Earth's surface, 
    given their latitude and longitude. The azimuth represents the angle between the north direction 
    and the line connecting the two points, measured clockwise.

        (e.g., `(latitude1, longitude1)`).
        point2 (tuple): A tuple containing the latitude and longitude of the second point 
        (e.g., `(latitude2, longitude2)`).

    Returns:
        float: The azimuth in degrees, ranging from 0° to 360°.

    Notes:
        - The calculation uses the haversine formula and trigonometric functions.
        - The azimuth is normalized to ensure it falls within the range of 0° to 360°.

def get_street_view_image(location, api_key, angle):
    """
    Fetch a Google Street View image and generate its corresponding Maps URL.

    This function requests a Street View image from the Google Street View Static API 
    for a given location and angle. It also computes the road orientation to adjust 
    the camera heading direction accordingly.

    Args:
        location (tuple): A tuple containing latitude and longitude as (lat, lon).
        api_key (str): Google Maps API key for authentication.
        angle (int or float): Angle adjustment for the Street View heading.

    Returns:
        tuple:
            - maps_url (str): A URL to visualize the location in Google Maps Street View.
            - img (np.ndarray or None): The fetched Street View image in OpenCV (BGR) format, 
              or `None` if the request fails.

    Effects:
        - Calls `get_road_orientation(location)` to determine the road direction.
        - Sends an HTTP request to the Google Street View API.
        - Converts the image response to a NumPy array and decodes it into an OpenCV image.
        - Prints an error message if the API request fails.

    Notes:
        - The API key is hardcoded in this function for now but should be stored securely 
          in a production environment.
        - The function ensures that the heading direction remains within [0, 360] degrees.
        - The field of view (FOV) is set to 120° for a wide-angle capture.
        - Uses a scale factor of 2 for higher image resolution.
        - Returns both the image and a Google Maps URL for additional visualization.
