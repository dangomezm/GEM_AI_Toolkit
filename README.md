# GEM AI Toolkit
This is the beta version of the toolkit for building feature prediction using facade images, for seismic risk assessment with AI. This toolkit allows analysis of images from Google Street View, using the Google API, and also supports images from the local device. The Graphic User Interface enables a fast assessment of the building, including an object detection module, to isolate the building of interest.
